Files contain stored data in the computer memory, when we want to create processes, we usually have to access the content of the file and load unto the computer memory. The basic operations we can perform on a file system include 
Create
Open
Read
Write
Append
Close 

Files have different permission statuses, we usually need to take these into account when trying to work on files. I have some basic file operation examples in this directory.
