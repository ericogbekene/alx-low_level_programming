Bit manipulation is a process of performing bitwise operations on a binary digit in the computer. Since we know all numbers are represented as a series of 8bits, it therefore enables us perform tasks more effiiently. e.g left shift << to multiply, right shift >> to divide. and so on.

We have the following operators 
&& - bitwise and operator
| - bitwise or operator
~ - bitwise not operator
^ - XOR operator
<< - left shift
>> - right shift
